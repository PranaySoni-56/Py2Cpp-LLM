# Py2Cpp-LLM 🐍➡️⚙️

Py2Cpp-LLM is an open-source tool that converts Python code into optimized C++ using open-source code generation LLMs such as **DeepSeek-Coder v2** and **Qwen2.5-Coder**. The project is designed for **local inference**, **zero paid APIs**, and **student-friendly setup** with a simple Gradio UI.


## 🚀 Why this project?

Python is easy to write but slower for performance-critical tasks, while C++ is fast but verbose.  
Py2Cpp-LLM bridges this gap by translating Python logic into efficient C++ using modern open-source LLMs.

This project helps:
- Convert Python algorithms into optimized C++
- Learn how high-level logic maps to low-level implementations
- Build a real-world AI + systems portfolio project
- Run everything locally without paid services


## 🎯 Project Scope

- Python → C++ code conversion
- Optimized C++ output (loops, references, STL usage)
- Model selection (DeepSeek / Qwen)
- Gradio-based web interface
- Fully local inference

> This is an **LLM-assisted code conversion tool**, not a compiler.
